Expanz > Proxy
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

The Expanz Proxy is a simple proxy server intended to be used when deploying a client application off-domain. This proxy allows any server to host an Expanz AppServer client.


## INSTALLATION

* Download the Expanz Proxy
* Deploy your favorite webserver

## RUNNING

The Expanz can be run on any webserver that supports PHP. The Proxy should only be run from the webserver you will be running your application on.

## FUTURE

The Expanz Proxy may be converted to Node.js application. This would reduce load on the primary webserver and make configuration easy, as long it can be deployed to Microsoft Windows Server.
